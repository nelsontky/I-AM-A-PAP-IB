# üê∂ I AM A PAP IB

## What is this?

Life is tough for a [PAP IB](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3jz2wr/eli5_pap_iboppo_ib/). 
We must post frequently on our minister's social media pages that sometimes it
is difficult to come up with fresh content. Thus, this site aims to help the IBs
get more efficient at their jobs. By training an AI model ([GPT2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/))
with the comments posted on the Facebook pages of Singapore's most popular PAP
politicians, this site is able to generate original comments that sound like
words out of an IB's fingers! Word of caution, there are quite some PAP bashers
on Facebook too and the AI model pick those up too so use with discretion!
Finally, I am in no way in agreement or support of any content that can be
found on the site. All content was generated from a complicated algorithm
which used Facebook comments as training data.
