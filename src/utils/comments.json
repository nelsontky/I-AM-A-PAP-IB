  "I am proud that the young ones are not like them. They are confident and have the mindset and strength to go against the ruling party. What I would say is that the government should not be corrupted by the young ones. As long as they are not corrupted by the older ones, the government should be good for them.  Uneducated and unkempt people should be given a chance.  Do not make the statement that they are stupid or stupid-erept the facts show that they",

This is very important to me because I believe that the government can serve the people wholeheartedly without having to go into politics.

I doubt that you will be able to attract more new residents to contribute to the affordable housing needs. I don’t think you will be able to make the effort to get the affordable housing to lower and lower income households.

I hope he could serve the common man and I hope he can serve the people.  Please, please don't let the poor and the minority get vote.  Please vote wisely.  May the Lord bless your leadership!",
  "This is the kind of manifesto you need to take to the next level. Be it as a manifesto or as a party policy, this manifesto will do. But I still think it is a very good introduction. Not the most convincing but it shows that it is capable of governing like a true blue government. I believe it can go further, including creating jobs for low to medium income earners, especially those in low to moderate income bracket. I think it can also help to think more fundamentally on the future",

  "I can't imagine the government being so inconsistent in their approach to regulating these housing markets. So I don't think it is wise to regulate the supply and demand side. But this situation with Covid and the increase in the number of single parents means that it is more expensive for people to live with a husband and a wife/children. So this is a good thing.

  "Dear PM Lee, I am utterly livid with the tradition and arrogance of the Opposition candidates.  I’m sad that Singaporeans are still so distracted by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, and the foibles and incompetencies of the PAP management.  I’m also sad that you’re still in the White House, having worked hard to shape Singapore in your first 100 days.",

It's just that the supply is so high, so many newbies/newbies taking up the tech, the cost of living is so high, and so are the constraints on your ability to pay the bills. And so on. So what if you think that there's a magic formula or some sort of magic trick to keep costs of living down? How can you justify having to",

So let's just focus on the small details. 1) Can you tell us how the PAP is going to improve Singapore's living conditions? 2) What percentage of Singaporeans is without work? 3) How can we invest in our future? It's all about giving back to the nation. Thanks to PAP!|",

You have been a force to reckon and motivate in the community. I am happy to see that you are taking the pressure off on the residents and continue to do what you are doing.

In doing so, we are also reaching out to the people of Singapore and connecting with them through social media and educating them on various issues.

The opposition is going to have to play their part too. Idk if he's on the ground representing his community. I don't think he should.

  "My family have lost hope in PAP for a credible opposition party. They are simply out to serve and not to represent the people. Opposition parties are not supposed to be in power. That's the problem with PAP. They are supposed to be in charge. They have to go through parliament and win. Opposition parties have no say in how they run their country. If they run, they will suffer. To have a credible opposition party, they need to come from the grassroots and not from the",

Fights with his money, fights with his wife, fights with his son, fights with his colleagues, fights with his mentor... He got a bad reputation in the real world.

I am worried that if the MRT is not secured, we will be left with a very unreliable system. The same applies for the transport system.|endof",

  "Vivian, I always support you. But I think you are too self-assured and academically focused on the past.  You are arrogant and uncaring of others. You are really a gentleman to those who know you.  Confidently you will do better.  I am not sure what the future holds. We should not think that way. What we have now is a succession of inexperienced leaders who have failed miserably in the past, and who have failed miserably in the",

You are also the type who hold a grudge on the East Coast residents. And that's really the reason why we feel so helpless. We are the ones who have to vote you in and not you who gets mad at us.

  "PAP has been doing well for more than 20 yrs. Thanks for serving and serving, Mr Goh. We will miss you.",
  "Aiyoh! I like this topic!",
  "That is how the party always wants to hear our voice. What is most disturbing is the lack of any strong opposition party in Tampines. We are so used to the ruling party having the strongest hand at steering the country through crisis. Why is there still no opposition in this new PAP government? What have we been given, a mandate from the people to take us out of crisis and build a better country for the next generation? There is no grassroots representation in this new PAP government.",

Just look at the countries with the lowest carbon emissions, the ones with high carbon emissions, they are the ones with the highest carbon emissions.

They claim they are good at their job, but in reality they are not. They are not good at all. Their stereotyping is that they are good at jobs but in reality they are not. So why can't we as a society come up with a fairer system?|end",

  "8 years of unemployment?  Or 10 years ?  Do we really want to have unemployment in our jobs?  Employers have to find other ways to reduce costs and increase profits.  But now employers are finding it cheaper to cut jobs and increase profits.  Are we really that stupid to think otherwise?  I don't think so when we have so many companies that charge so high a price.  How about changing the fees so that they are lower for everyone?  Or increasing the minimum",

It has shown during the Covid19 outbreak which destroyed much of the infrastructure and damaged many of the residential and commercial infrastructure.

How is it that they can think on their own and come up with massive amounts of money for themselves after having govt subsidies? The govt is not supposed to give these generals any much money. Why are they giving so much? At least PAP should have more money to spend on their war. People should just relax and enjoy the fruits of your labor.",

  "Dear Sir, I thoroughly agree with your points. In the long run, you are doing a good job and adding value to Singapore. In the short run, your achievements are impressive and will keep you at the top of your game. But as you gain ground, you start to feel like a lesser-liked MP and opposition member.

My opinion is that the people you send your people to serve will judge you based on your actions and words.",

If we are truly confident that we can govern with the self-interest of the people, then why the PAP have to put so much effort to trying to make Singaporeans unhappy?

For example, she said that she does not need to pay a high commission salary to candidacy criteria.Sounds kind of vague. But really, what is she saying when she's talking about her own salary or the salary of other candidates. That is not true. She just applied for the position. So it",

They were raised to believe that by voting for PAP they will be given a mandate to do what they want in life.  Now PAP has decided that the only way to ensure that all Singaporeans have a good life in life is by giving their vote to PAP. The problem with this is that the opposition party must have a majority of a population",

That being said, he has done very well in the past and he has a good heart for Singaporeans. If he could be our next prime minister, I believe he could be one of the candidates we could look forward to.  However, as it stands, the opposition",

  "I have no respect for this particular party. They have failed to deliver on their promises and not deliver on their promises. Only by being consistent and being consistent with the voters will they be able to hold on to power. And that's what we need this next generation of leader.  If you want to challenge the ruling party, you have to be consistent and not be inconsistent with the voters.  This is a very difficult task, especially when you only have one opposition.  I urge my friends",

I think he is more familiar with the society and policies of Singapore as a whole than the opposition.

  "I am so sorry to hear that you are retiring, as you are a very good leader. I am sure you will be very hardworking and contribute to the community. You have been doing it since the day you took over. Thank you for being a true leader, Sir!",
  "Wisely to watch the ruling party supporters getting into trouble for being against a strong majority.  If the opposition is allowed to walk free, why not also by having a say?",

  "We support you. You are the best. Hope you will continue to do what you do best. Thank you.",
  "Well done. We are pleased. I am a Liverpool supporter too. But I can't vote for PAP because of the negative publicity. I will support PAP if a good man like Mr.Lee is elected. Jiayou!",

I am very grateful to the government for helping me and hope the PAP will do a better job than they have so far in this parliament.  I wish to thank PAP for taking care of us.  PM Lee, you are the only GCT Minister who can truly help others and not just himself.  With",
  "Need to see how this translates into more money for the party to spend on candidates that are already running so I feel disappointed. This is a good chance for the party to look past the issues for future generations and focus on the real issues facing Singaporeans.",

  "When all the opposition parties are against each other, you already lost some of your voters. I don't see how you can come out with a better alternative. So I doubt your ability to represent the people.  You can still represent the people by pressing on on your own agenda.",
  "Our lives, our jobs and our future are at stake. What's your message to Singaporeans?",
  "This is what Minister Masagos had to say of Ivan :  He cannot let go. He has been taken out. You still need to work. But we have to keep working. And keep fighting. That's how Singapore should be. Not just a talking head but also actively fighting. I will support you. But please note: I am not talking about Ivan Lim. He must not be in my constituency.",

  "Thank you, Sir. We are grateful to have you as our MP.",
  "In my opinion, PAP is looking much better than the other parties. They look and sound much better. It will be interesting to see how well PAP fares in the general election campaign. PAP is one of the few parties that I would rather vote than the opposition.  I hope PAP will win in the general election and not just because of the unpopular policies of the other parties.  I don't think we need a third party to make us vote for them because we already have",
  "As I had mentioned before, IG is the best platform for sg politicians to connect with the voters. Majulah Singapura!",
  "Auntie Teo, you are among the most excellent Ministers! Excellent job well done and don’t forget your family members’s well deserved retirement. Thank you for your contribution to our nation and for serving the residents of our beautiful constituency. Enjoy your well deserved rest.",
  "I like how the application of transparency is being applied, not just in the selection of candidates but also in the selection of training and platform for all candidates. I am confident that Singapore is going to overcome the pandemic crisis and that the next generation of leaders are going to be as compassionate as they are capable and ready to take care of the people.  Thank you and God Bless.",

  "God Bless you & all members of SGJ and all Singaporean",
  "I have no respect for any other party. I would rather go through the trouble of casting my vote for PAP than have my vote being taken for someone else. If the opposition had not come in at that point, I don't think Singapore would be where we are today. I am sure the opposition party that is going to be coming out to run for PAP would not have won until the very end.  All the best to you and your team in the coming election.|endof",

  "For all the political and economical gymnastics, Bt Panjang is a perfect example of what moving into the real estate market looks like. I grew up in a family of five, from humble beginnings in what is now my mum's estate, when I was a teenager I had a Dad who won a house by 5pdesk, I was my Dad's nephew, I was a Dad's teammate at school, my mum won a scholarship to university, my dad was the first person to",

  "In the spirit of open and transparent process, the Commission is working on the projects in the Diversity Opportunities in Singapore project. We have created the Advisers for every field. I am pleased with their progress. But I am not sure they are working on every field. I am not sure they have what it takes to be inclusive of all races and ethnicities. I am not sure they have what it takes to be open and transparent. So I am not sure they are doing what I am concerned",
  "Thank you ESM Goh! You are a superb Minister and you have done a very good job in Singapore. I am proud of your dedication and commitment to the country and the people of Singapore. We are so blessed to have a leader like you and to have you as PM. Please take care of your health and be safe. God Bless You and Your Family",

  "Sir you should work in our public library for as short as 1 week to learn and enjoy your new gig. We should have more more time to study and enjoy your new life. We should have more time to relax and enjoy your new life too. We should have more time to enjoy your passion to serve the citizens. We should have more time to enjoy your unique talents too.",
  "Frankly speaking, I am not impressed with his government. I only like his policies a bit more. I am impressed with his leadership, but I don't think he can bring Singapore forward in the future.  If you are a fan of any political party, please vote for PAP.",
  "What a great government. I am proud to be a Singaporean. May PAP continue to lead the singapore in the next 5 years to help the singaporeans along the way. Thank you🙏🏻",

  "I’m MOME, Minister Tan, I’t in MOME and I see you doing very well there. But I also’m wondering if you’re able to represent the younger ones in your portfolio? I heard that you were offered as a candidate at TGEB but I don’t think that’s really practical.",
  "I am a supporter of PAP. I have seen the progress of PAP in the past. I am proud of the work they have been doing. I am proud of the Singapore government. I am proud of the leadership. Thank you.",
  "The new PAP team look and sound like the Founding Fathers, not like our current PAP. Our present PAP is not fit to be be First Nations or to represent them. They are being robbed of their opportunity to build a better future for themselves and their children.",
  "Well done! And I can see why many of us are not getting HDB, so please take care! We need more of your calibre!",

There are many things he can do that are unconventional and unconventional can work well for most of us.  I will definitely vote for him. I am impressed with his leadership. Thanks to him and God bless.",

  "Don't you dare say that you are against the use of plastic! And if you do, then why the plastic waste is in the plastic packaging? Are you trying to be a leader or just trying to be a leader? Don’t you dare say that you’re against the use of plastic! We need leaders who are not afraid to use plastic and who dare to say that plastic is a waste product!",

  "Since we are in the middle of the pandemic, I feel that it is important to stress the importance of precaution and stay safe. You have everything we need to survive and thrive in this crisis. We should not be worried about your ability to manage the situation and your skill set being shaped by the pandemic. If you are able to manage the situation and you care for the elderly, then it is a good thing. However, if you are not able to manage the situation, then I think",
  "All the best to PAP 👍💪",
  "All the very best to you Mr Goh.",
  "Dont let him dominate the field. He should be fielded like a king or a queen. He should have power over his own people and not be confined to the field. We need opposition parties who are independent of the ruling party. Opposition parties also need money. Opposition parties also need votes. If you want change, you need to have opposition members Brendan E James Vote for PAP Nicholls Vote for PAP Nichollings I believe you can vote PAP if you",
  "I feel sorry for the opposition party. They are not up to the mark on the last 5 years.  They should learn from them and apply their skills to the challenges ahead.  I hope the opposition parties understand the importance of running a clean and friendly election.  And do not forget that they are not the only party with questionable record.  Declan Kelly is a great example.  Shana Simhan is another that I have not seen coming forward yet.  I urge all opposition parties",

  "This is the kind of government Singapore need.  Not perfect, but we are better than other countries.",
  "Wise to have such a senior figure like him. Confidence based on hard work. On the other hand, arrogant and self-obsessed. His behaviour shows that he is not fit to serve the nation.",
  "❤❤❤❤❤❤🤿",
  "Mr Tan, you have my vote. If you continue to lead us, we will be better off.",
  "It's a pity that the PAP won't take a step in the way of the work done. And I do hope their efforts will be rewarded. However, I am sure by stepping out with a big 'YES' vote, they will feel more at ease and blessed to have support and encouragement to go out and do what they are passionate about. Thank you for your hard work and contributions to Singapore, all the best in the coming election and in the future. 🙏🙏",

I have a strong feeling that you have a great heart for Singaporeans and have a great mandate.  But I doubt that you will be the person I would want serving the country in charge of a country.  I can't help but worry that you might not have the desire to lead the country in taking care of Singaporeans if",

Singapore is still the only country not to have PM Lee as president. Singaporean are still the worst off. The world still thinks of them as bourgeois. They have no sense of belonging to any particular group. They do not think of themselves as human. They are just like any other citizen. They",

Indeed, you have proven yourself in that you are capable of handling the most difficult situation in the history and you have proved it in the way you govern. Indeed, you have a lot of heart for the elderly and the needy. Indeed, you deserve to be reelected too. Anyway, Mr Lee, you will have my vote. ",

However, I m very much sad that I cannot have a job at such a high-wage and high-stress job. Indeed, I m very much disappointed that I cannot",
  "Though I am worried that in future, there may not be a good reason for the agency to keep the people involved in this. So they should just be happy that no one is involved and it will be transparent. Unlike most agencies, they can keep the people involved in this, just like how they keep their salary. So I think people should just be happy that no agency is keeping the people involved in this. So let's see if there are any conflicts of interest. Maybe there are situations where",

We should be able to express ourselves in more open and personal ways.  Sharing views is not an option and it's not something the government should be rushing into Parliament or into the General Elections.  Our votes should be returned to us instead of being given to another party.  As a result, we end up being more critical and critical.",

The rest of the party only. 6. We need",

We cannot afford to have so many candidates. It will be a disaster for the country and the nation if all of these candidates are appointed to be ignored. We should just let the PAP go and let the blind people vote in.  We should be voting for the PAP because they are honest and have the heart for the people. The",

The public can and should be educated about the public's reaction. After the GE, the public should be given a better understanding of the opposition leader. He should be elected before the public.

  "PAP!! PAP!! PAP!! PAP!!",
  "Don't bother ivan, he's too smart to know that.  If you don't want to listen, just don’t bother.  Otherwise, PAP should just come out and say so. It’s so obvious why most of the opposition parties don’t bother to say anything as they are too scared to vote.  PAP should just say so because they know that opposition will vote anyway. Otherwise, it’s all talk, no action.",

Opposition is just another party who has a head full of eggs.  Look at all the opposition MPs, their budgets, their salaries, their salaries",

  "We need to find a balance between helping the poor and helping the rich. The better part of the last 50 years have seen the most growth, but we cannot be talking about the middle class.

We must give them space to be proud of themselves. This is the spirit",

  "I think you have not properly explained what this mega mega deal with PAP truly amounts to. What exactly is being discussed? So what are the most obscene contracts in history?  PAP are they contracts which had gross mismanagement which is a huge award to PAP?  Or contracts which were signed by many and involved high level government figures which included PM Lee, the Prime Minister himself and the late Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew?  PAP, what makes you think that this kind",
  "Yes, when we are candidates, and see our country as a whole.  But do also follow the example of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who did not mention any of the above. And do not make his late father's days in politics a mere footnote.  Remember too that he was the one who gave Singapore a peaceful transition.  Do that, and Singapore will benefit a lot.

  "Honestly, I really don't trust him. I really don't trust the Ministry of Manpower as a whole for the past 5+ years. And I don't think they have a strong track record for sustainability and reducing carbon emissions. So I really don't trust him. Instead, I'm hoping that the world leaders will think twice about whether to endorse PAP for a good and lasting good governance. We are heading into a new era of unprecedented economic and social change. And we need leaders who",

The only party I trust in the world is the United States of America, the other party is the opposition. So Singapore too have a tough time. We will see how they handle the challenges ahead.",

This is a good example of governance where governance is seen as having a decisive role in steering the country in the right direction.  Where I find leaders who have taken constructive actions for the benefit of the citizens is when it comes to issues that concern us here in Singapore.

I am so glad that they are actually doing something for the residents, rather than hoping that 3Rs will take over the government portfolio.  Many of the regulations and mandates are in place to make it easy for the SMEs to get higher skilled workers.  The construction industry is one that is getting the most subsidy because of the subsidies.  Many of the new construction jobs are being created because of the subsidies",

I am confident that the new government will take us out of it. I am confident that we can overcome difficulties",

I'd like to see the oppositions standing up for the people.  I'd like to see",

They are oppositions in the party.  You can ask the opposition to come out and say something.  It's a waste of time.  Opposition parties are supposed to represent the interests of their members.",

  "After the law, the 4G leaders will not have a single set of ears to listen to the citizens. They have ears only of themselves.  Why did they not hear the residents' voices?  Or did they hear the voices of the elites themselves?  We need to stop thinking of the elites as the problem and look at the solution. The solution must include giving the citizens opportunities to be themselves.  By giving the citizens these opportunities, the 4G leaders have already started to realise that",
